    Asynchronously runs the main simulation loop for robot path planning and execution.
    This function waits for a goal to be set, connects to the CoppeliaSim simulation environment,
    and starts the simulation. In a continuous loop, it fetches sensor data for multiple robots,
    selects and commands the nearest robot to execute a path toward the goal, and generates plots
    for sensor data and paths. The loop handles replanning if obstacles are detected and terminates
    when the robot reaches the goal or fails. Handles graceful shutdown on user interruption.
    Raises:
        KeyboardInterrupt: If the user interrupts the execution.
