class PathExecutor:
    """
    Executes a given path for a robot in a simulated environment, handling motion, obstacle avoidance, and alignment.
    Args:
        sim: The simulation environment object.
        robot: The robot object or identifier.
        wheels: The wheels or actuators associated with the robot.
    Attributes:
        sim: The simulation environment object.
        motion: Instance of RobotMotion for controlling robot movement.
        robot: The robot object or identifier.
        Neglect_Obstacle (bool): Flag indicating whether to ignore detected obstacles.
    Methods:
        async get_position():
            Retrieves the current (x, y) position of the robot.
        async follow_path(path):
            Follows a sequence of waypoints, moving the robot along the specified path.
            Handles goal reaching, obstacle detection, and replanning if necessary.
        async check_alignment(direction, coordinates_for_goal, dist_front, dist_back, dist_left, dist_right):
            Checks if the robot is aligned with the goal along the X or Y axis, considering obstacles.
            Returns alignment status or instructions for further movement.
        async move_to_goal(goal):
            Moves the robot towards a single goal position, handling velocity computation, obstacle detection,
            and alignment. Returns status indicating movement progress, completion, or failure.
        async handle_obstacle(Robot, direction, goal, dx, dy, vx, vy):
            Handles detected obstacles by temporarily replanning the path to avoid them.
            Moves the robot to a temporary goal until the obstacle is cleared or handling fails.
