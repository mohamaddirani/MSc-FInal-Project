class PathExecutor:
    """
    Executes a planned path for a robot in a simulation environment, handling movement, obstacle avoidance, and goal alignment.
    Attributes:
        sim: The simulation environment object.
        motion: An instance of RobotMotion for controlling robot movement.
        robot: The robot object or identifier.
        cleared (str): Flag indicating if an obstacle has been cleared ("True"/"False").
        Failed (str): Flag indicating if path execution has failed ("True"/"False").
    Methods:
        __init__(sim, robot, wheels):
            Initializes the PathExecutor with the simulation, robot, and wheels.
        async get_position():
            Retrieves the current (x, y) position of the robot.
        async follow_path(path):
            Follows a given path (list of waypoints), moving the robot to each goal while handling obstacles and alignment.
            Returns "DONE" if the path is completed, "FAILED" if execution fails, or "replanned" if replanning is triggered.
        async move_to_goal(goal):
            Moves the robot towards a specified goal, checking for obstacles and alignment.
            Returns "MOVING" if still in progress, "DONE" if the goal is reached, "FAILED" if blocked, or "replanned" if replanning is needed.
        async check_alignment(direction, coordinates_for_goal):
            Checks if the robot is aligned with the goal along the X or Y axis based on obstacle direction and goal coordinates.
            Returns "X-AXIS ALIGNED", "Y-AXIS ALIGNED", or None.
        async handle_obstacle(Robot, direction, goal, dx, dy):
            Handles obstacle avoidance by moving towards a temporary goal to bypass the obstacle.
            Updates the 'cleared' and 'Failed' flags based on the outcome.
