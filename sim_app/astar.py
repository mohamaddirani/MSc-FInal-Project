    AStar pathfinding algorithm implementation for grid-based environments.
    Attributes:
        agent_dict (dict): Dictionary containing agent information, including start and goal positions.
        admissible_heuristic (callable): Function to compute the heuristic estimate from a state to the goal.
        is_at_goal (callable): Function to check if a given state is the goal for a specific agent.
        get_neighbors (callable): Function to retrieve neighboring states and their move costs.
    Methods:
        reconstruct_path(came_from, current):
            Reconstructs the path from the start node to the current node using the came_from mapping.
        search(agent_name):
            Performs the A* search algorithm for the specified agent.
            Returns the path from start to goal as a list of states if a path is found, otherwise returns False.
