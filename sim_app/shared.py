"""
Shared module for storing global state and data structures used across the simulation application.
Attributes:
    robot_name (str or None): Name of the robot, can be set dynamically.
    latest_data (defaultdict): Stores the latest signal data for any signal name, with default as an empty list.
    all_sensor_data (defaultdict): Stores all sensor data for any signal name, with default as an empty list.
    latest_astar_path (list): Stores the most recently computed A* path.
    executed_path (list): Stores the path that has been executed by the robot.
    planned_path (list): Stores the currently planned path for the robot.
    robot_goal (list): The current goal position for the robot, as a list (e.g., [x, y]).
    robot_start (tuple): The starting position of the robot, as a tuple (x, y).
